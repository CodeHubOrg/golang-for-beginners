Today is a beautiful day.
Tomorrow might be even more beautiful, if the rain stops finally.
Nevermind the hailstorm, it's a wonderful day out nonetheless.
The will of the people is to plant willows and sleep on pillows.
I'm willing to row if marmaids don't follow the boat in the morning sunrise.
I'm cheerful and full of optimism that our ally will arrive in the midday sun.
How about the hermit though, it's always so unpredictable to torment my soul.
