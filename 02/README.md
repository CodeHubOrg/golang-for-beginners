## Usage
```console
$ go run main.go
```
This will print a procedurally generated text starting with `This beautiful morning will`

You can also customise how the text is generated by providing various parameters when executing the program.

For example the following will instruct the program to append an additional 1000 characters to the starting text
```console
$ go run main.go -i=1000
```

For more options run
```console
$ go run main.go -h
```
